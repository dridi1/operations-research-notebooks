    "Peter Parker is interning at OsCorp, a leading technology company. As part of his internship, he is working on the development of a high-performance  fluid used in the creation of material that mimics spider's webs mechanical properties, hereafter web fluid. Peter needs to determine the optimal blend of ingredients to produce the web fluid with the desired mechanical properties (strength, flexibility, and adhesion) at the lowest cost. The web fluid is composed of three ingredients: Ingredient A, Ingredient B, and Ingredient C. The goal is to minimize the cost of producing a batch of web fluid while meeting the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The web fluid must have a minimum strength of 80 units.\n",
    "- The web fluid must have a flexibility between 50 and 100 units (inclusive).\n",
    "- The web fluid must have an adhesion level of at least 90 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of each ingredient is as follows:\n",
    "- Ingredient A: 5 dollars per liter\n",
    "- Ingredient B: 4 dollars per liter\n",
