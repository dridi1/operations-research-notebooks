    "\n",
    "The mixer is fully used (slack of 0 in the mixer constraint). A reduction of the availability of the mixer would lead to a reduction in the production of the drinks. The minimum Right-Hand-Side (RHS) indicates that the current optimal solution will remain in the same basic solution as long as the availability is greater than 3 hours. This means that the production of both products A and B will remain as long as the mixer is available for at least 3 hours. If the mixer is available for less than 3 hours, the optimal solution will no longer remain in the same basic solution. Therefore, the company can deal with this type of problem by ensuring that the mixer is available for at least 3 hours per day. \n",

    "\n",
    "The shadow price of the ingredient D constraint is 2. This means that the company is willing to pay up to 2€ for an additional gram of ingredient D. The maximum RHS of the ingredient D is 4.5 grams. Therefore, the company should negotiate with the new supplier to provide the additional ingredient D at a price lower than 2€ per gram, increasing the daily supply from 3 grams to 4.5 grams. This will ensure that the basic variables remain the same, and the company can increase its daily supply of ingredient D without affecting the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The managers of the company would like to review the prices of both products. Analyse how changes in the prices of both products could affect the production plan and provide useful feedback to guide the revision of the prices (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, with the current prices, the Production of product A is not profitable for the company (0 Liters). Since the reduced cost is -3 euros, the company should increase the price of product A to at least 6 euros per liter to make it profitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a look at product B, the production of product B is profitable for the company (3 Liters). The price could be inreased without affecting the production plan. However, the company should be careful decreasing the price of product B, as the lower bound for the price per liter (objective function coefficient) is 1 euro.\n",
