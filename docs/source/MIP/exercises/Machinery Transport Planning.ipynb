    "A firm must transport machines from production plants A, B and C to warehouses X, Y and Z. Five machines are required in X, four in Y and three in Z and there are eight machines available in A, five in B and three in C.\n",
    "**a)** Create and solve a Graph Theory model to determine the maximal flow of the machines that can be transported and the run of this flow.\n",
    "**b)** By assuming a mean cost of â‚¬45 per transported machine, what would the total cost be of transporting the machines obtained in the former section?"
