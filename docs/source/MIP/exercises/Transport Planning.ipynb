    "# Transport Planning\n",
    "A firm must transport machines from production plants A, B and C to warehouses X, Y and Z. Five machines are required in X, 4 in Y and 3 in Z, whereas 8 machines are available in A, 5 in B and 3 in C. The transport costs (in euros) between sites\n",

    "**b)** Assume that the cost of transporting a machine from plant B increases by â‚¬10 for all the machines as of the third one; that is, the 4th, the 5th, etc. Reformulate the model in Section a) by considering this assumption."
