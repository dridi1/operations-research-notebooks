    "PLACASA, a supplier of plastic injection parts for the automobile sector, foresees the demand of an article for the following 4 months of 100, 140, 210 and 180 units, respectively. The firm can maintain only sufficient stock to meet the demand of each month or it can have excess stock to meet the demand of two successive months or more with a storage cost of 1.2€ per month and unit of excessive stock. \n",
    "PLACASA calculates that the production cost for the following months, is €15, €12, €10 and €14 per unit. A preparation cost of €200 is incurred every time a production order is placed. The firm wishes to develop a production plan that minimises the total costs of production orders, of production and of keeping an article in stock. Formulate and solve a shortest path model to find an optimum production plan."
