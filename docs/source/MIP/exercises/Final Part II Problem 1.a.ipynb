    "# Final Exam (Solved)\n",
    "## Part II\n",
    "### Problem 1\n",
    "You need to design the distribution network of a company that has several production plans and manufactures different types of products.\n",
    "You have build a mathematical programming model to optimise your distribution network design.\n",
    "You have to use the following data in your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the transportation cost per unit of product and product type from a production plan to a warehouse\n",
    "- the transportation cost per unit of product and product type from a warehouse to a retail region\n",
    "- the handling costs per unit of product at every warehouse\n",
    "- the yearly fixed operation costs of every warehouse\n",
    "- The yearly demand for every product at every retail region\n",
    "- The maximum production capacity of every production plant for every product\n",
    "\n",
    "Your company policy states that you must satisfy the demand of every region from a single warehouse.\n",
    "Your company also states that you cannot use more than C different warehouses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write down:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** The indices, input data and decision variables of your model (1 point)\n",
    "The indices to use are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- i: production plans\n",
    "- j: warehouses\n",
    "- k: retail regions\n",
    "- l: product types\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data are:\n",
    "- $S_{ijl}$: Transportation cost per unit of product l from production plan i to warehouse j\n",
    "- $T_{jkl}$: Transportation cost per unit of product l from warehouse j to retail region k\n",
    "- $H_{jl}$: Handling cost per unit of product l in warehouse j \n",
    "- $F_j$: Yearly fixed operation costs of warehouse j\n",
    "- $D_{kl}$: Yearly demand of product l at retail region k\n",
    "- $M_{il}$: Maximum production capacity of production plant i for product l\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X_{ijl}$: Units of product l to transport from production plan i to warehouse j \n",
    "- $Y_{jkl}$: Units of product l to transport from warehouse j to retail region k\n",
    "- $W_{jk}$: binary {1 if the warehouse j supplies the retailer region k } {0 otherwise}\n",
    "- $I_{j}$: Binary decision variable that represents the selection of a warehouse j {1: we use a warehouse, 0: otherwise}\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** The objective function (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transportation costs from production plans to warehouses\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{t1} = \\sum_i{\\sum_j{\\sum_l{S_{ijl}·X_{ijl}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transportation cost from warehouses to retail regions\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{t2} = \\sum_j{\\sum_k{\\sum_l{T_{jkl}·Y_{jkl}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling costs\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_h = \\sum_j{\\sum_k{\\sum_l{H_{jl}·Y_{jkl}}}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yearly fixed operation costs\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_f = \\sum_j{I_{j}·F_{j}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective function\n",
    "$\\min z = C_{t1} + C_{t2} + C_h + C_f$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\min z = \\sum_i{\\sum_j{\\sum_l{S_{ijl}·X_{ijl}}}} + \\sum_j{\\sum_k{\\sum_l{T_{jkl}·Y_{jkl}}}} + \\sum_j{\\sum_k{\\sum_l{H_{jl}·Y_{jkl}}}} + \\sum_j{I_{j}·F_{j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**c.** The constraints (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demands:\n",
    "The demand in every region and for every product must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{Y_{jkl}}= D_{kl} \\forall k, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Material flows:\n",
    "The amount of each product that leaves a warehouse cannot be higher than the amount of product that enters a warehouse. Assuming that we do not storing any amount for next periods, then both variables are equal instead of less or equal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}{X_{ijl}} = \\sum_{k}{Y_{jkl}} \\forall j, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Production capacities:\n",
    "The amount of a each product produced in a plant must not exceed production capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{X_{ijl}} \\leq M_{il} \\forall i, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Company Policy constraint:\n",
    "The number of warehouses must not exceed the limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{I_{j}} \\leq C$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Source Constraint: \n",
    "Each region receives all its products from only one warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{W_{jk}} = 1 \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical constraints: \n",
    "Finally, it is necessary to introduce some logical constraints. First, a warehouse must be built if it supplies to any region.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ W_{jk} \\leq I_{j} \\forall j, \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both decision variables are binary, with this constraint we make sure that if any warehouse supplies to a region, i.e. if any $W_{jk}$ for any value of k is 1, then we must build a warehouse in that location, i.e. $Y_{j}$ must be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a warehouse will supply a region only when the amount transported of all products from such warehouse to such region is non zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{l}Y_{jkl} \\leq M·W_{jk} \\forall j, \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "where M is a very large number\n",
    "\n",
    "**d.** Could you use network theory to solve your model? Motivate your response (1 point)\n",
    "Yes, it is possible to build a network where nodes represent locations (warehouses, retail regions, production plants) and edges represent transport paths. Edges must have different attributes to account for the costs and capacities. "
