    "First, we need to consider the single source constraint, to make sure that only 1 truck delivers to a gas station: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{X_{ij}}=1 \\quad \\forall i$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demand constraint**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also need to into account the **demand**, to make sure that we satisfy the daily demand in each gas station:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{d_i*X_{ij}}=d_i \\quad \\forall i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these two constraints (single source delivery constraint and demand constraint) are **equivalent**. We can just use the former in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacity constraint**\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to take into account the **capacity constraint** to make sure that the amount delivered from any truck is lower than its capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}{d_i*X_{ij}} \\leq c_j \\quad \\forall j$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical constraint**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to introduce a logical constraint as well, to make sure that the binary decision variables are consistent with each other. Basically, we need to ensure that we only use one truck (i.e $Y_j=1$) when it delivers to any gas station (i.e. any $X_{ij}$ = 1 for the same j):\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{ij} \\leq Y_j \\quad \\forall i, \\forall j$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to express the logical constraint is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}{X_ij} \\leq M*Y_j \\quad \\forall i, \\forall j$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where M is a very large number. In this form, basically what we say is that if a truck is not used (i.e. $Y_j=0$), then the sum of the gas stations it delivers to must be 0. Otherwise, if it is used (i.e. $Y_j=0$), the sum has to be lower than a very large number M.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, we can also merge this logical constraint with the capacity constraint to yield: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}{d_i*X_ij} \\leq c_jY_j \\quad \\forall j$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this form, the right hand side of the logical constraint is modified to take into account the quantity that each truck delivers when it is used, and the right hand side is modified to take into account the maximum capacity of the truck, when it is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, our model can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min z = \\sum{Y_j·Co_j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s.t.$ \n",
