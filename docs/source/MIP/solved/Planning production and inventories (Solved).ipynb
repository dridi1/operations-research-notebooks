    "incurred. Any excess products manufactured during early periods can be stored to\n",
    "meet the demand for the next period. Besides, all the demand must be met during\n",
    "each period. Production capacity constraints are not considered.\n",

    "costs of production, storage and fixed costs\n",

    "*b)* Assume that we are allowed to have a delay of one period. Delays in deliveries have a cost $crd_{t}$ per demand unit not delivered on time during each period. However, all the demand must\n",
    "be met during the last period T, or in other words, a delay in the demand during\n",
    "period T must be null. Amend the model in the former section to contemplate\n",

    "*c)* Assume that production can take place in a maximum of five periods, although\n",
