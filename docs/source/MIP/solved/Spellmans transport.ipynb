    "# Spellman's Distribution Network Optimization\n",
    "Spellman's would like Sabrina to focus on the optimization of their distribution network, to support the distribution of the 2 types of drinks from 3 sourcing facilities to 4 destination warehouses, through 6 intermediate warehouses. Sabrina needs to take into account the transportation costs (both from sourcing warehouses to intermediate warehouses and from intermediate warehouses to final destinations). Additionally, Sabrina can decide how many of the 6 intermediate solutions to use, given that they have a fixed operational cost that needs to be paid when the warehouse is used.\n",

    "\n",
    "A greedy algorithm would solve the problem by making a series of decisions that are locally optimal at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. The algorithm would start by selecting the intermediate warehouse with the lowest operational cost and then select the sourcing warehouse that minimizes the transportation cost to that intermediate warehouse. The algorithm would then select the destination warehouse that minimizes the transportation cost from the intermediate warehouse. This process would be repeated for each product type until all constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution to the transportation problem. However, it is computationally efficient and can provide a good solution in a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm is particularly useful when the problem is large and complex, as it can quickly generate a feasible solution that can be used as a starting point for more sophisticated optimization techniques."
