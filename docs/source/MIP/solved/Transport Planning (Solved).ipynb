    "\n",
    "$\\sum_j{x_{Bj}} - 3 \\geq 0$ (and as per the previous constraint, the sum can only be equal to 3). \n",

    "\n",
    "$x*_{Bj} \\leq M \\quad \\forall j$ (irrelevant because M is a really large number)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas if Y = 1, the logical constraints become:\n",

    "$\\sum_j{x_{Bj}}\\leq 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_j{x_{Bj}} - 3 + M \\geq 0$ (irrelevant because M is a really large number)\n",

    "\n",
    "$x*_{Bj} \\leq 0 \\quad \\forall j$ (and since they cannot be negative, they must be equal to zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the constraint $\\sum_j{x_{Bj}} - 3 \\leq M*(1-Y)$ is irrelevant when Y=0 and when Y=1, it is removed and we get the \n",
