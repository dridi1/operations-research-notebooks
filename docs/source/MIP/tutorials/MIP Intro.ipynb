    "# Mixed integer Programming\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) can be regarded as an extension of Continuous Linear Programming where any of or all the defined decision variables cannot take fractional values.\n",
    "MIP introduces two new types of variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer variables:** Integer variables can only take Integer values. Normally, Integer variables are introduced by logical restrictions that make rational valuables unfeasible. For instance, in some instances of production mix problems, it does not make sense to produce fractional parts of a product and treating them as real number is just an approximation. \n",
    "- **Binary variables:** Binary variables or Boolean variables can only take values 1 or 0. Normally, binary variables are used to factor into our model binary decisions, eg to decide whether to use a machine configuration or another, or whether to select one element from a set or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "In CLP, the continuity of the decision variables ensures that the feasibility region and the objective function intersect in a vertex of the feasible region at the optimal value. But this is no longer the case when some of the decision variables are Integer values. Intuitively, one can think that the optimal value may be found in one of the feasible Integer values *around* the theoretical intersection, as long as the solution is feasible. This makes the number of candidate solutions larger and consequently, MIP problems are more difficult to solve. \n",
    "From a mathematical point of view, when the decision variables are not continuous, the feasible region and the objective function are no longer convex. Convexity of feasibility region and objective function ensures that the optimal solution is at one vertex. We will explain this concept further in Non Linear Programming. For now, it is sufficient to understand that in MIP, the feasibility region is not longer convex since not all values are possible and this makes it harder to find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation makes convergence to an optimal solution more complex. MIP solution is several orders of magnitude more complex that linear programming. For instance, the assumptions made to design the Simplex algorithm do not longer hold and although adaptations may find an optimal solution, convergence is so slow that they cannot be applied to practical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up\n",
    "In general, the set up of MIP problems is the same as the set up of CLP problems, except that some of the decision variables can only take Integer values. For instance: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\max z = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}{c_j·x_j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s.t.$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{1j}·x_j}\\leq b_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{2j}·x_j}\\leq b_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$...$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{mj}·x_j}\\leq b_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_j \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers the formulation of some well known combinatorial optimization problems as IP problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Knapsack Problem\n",
    "Recall that in the Knapsack problem, given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, we need to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total value is maximised while the total weight is less than or equal than the maximum weight the knapsack can hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can express the objective function as the value of the items selected: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\max z = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}{v_j·x_j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s.t.$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{w_{j}·x_j}\\leq W$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_j$ is the value of the item $j$ and the decision variables are binary, that is $x_j \\in [0, 1]$. The value 0 means that the object is not selected and therefore has no impact in the objective function. Likewise, the value 1 means that the object is selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is subject to the maximum weight $W$ constraint. The sum of the weights $w_j$ of the selected variables has to be less or equal than the maximum weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "Recall the classic formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): \n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a list of *cities* and the *distances* between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications, *cities* represent different steps in a process, and *distances* represent the cost of a sequence of steps in the process, from one step to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for the setup of the TSP as an IP, we have the following variables and coefficients: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{ij}$: Binary decision variables that represent a sequence from source i to destination j. 1 means that the step is selected in the final sequence, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- $c_{ij}$: Represents the cost the step in the sequence, in the classical formulation, the cost of travelling from city i to city j. \n",
    "- $u_i$: Integer variable that represents the step of $i$ in the sequence. If $u_i$ is equal to $t$ then city $i$ is departed at step $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The IP formulation is then as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min z = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N}{c_{ij}*x_{ij}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s.t$\n",
    "We can only depart from 1 city: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{N}{x_{ij}} = 1 \\forall i$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can only arrive to a city from a city: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x_{ij}} = 1 \\forall j$\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot travel in loops in a city: \n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{ij} = 0 \\forall i=j$\n",
    "\n",
    "We travel from city i to city j exactly at step $u_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u_i - u_j + n*x_{ij} = n-1 \\forall i \\in 2 \\leq i \\neq j \\leq n$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no loops, we do not allow $u_i$ to be arbitrarily large:\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 \\leq u_i \\leq n- \\forall i \\in 2 \\leq i \\leq n$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques\n",
    "There are different techniques used to solve MIP problems, among which we can highlight the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relaxation\n",
    "Relaxation is basically formulating the MIP problem as if all decision variables where continuous, and therefore reducing the MIP problem to a CLP problem. Relaxation allows the decision maker to use the Simplex method and perform a sensitivity analysis. The Solution may be not feasible, but it might provide some insights into the possible solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cutting Planes (Gomory’s Algorithm)\n",
    "The Gomory´s algorithm is an extension of relaxation. First, the problem is forumlated as a CLP. When the solution is found, new constraints are introduced to *cut* the fractional part of one of the Integer variables out of the feasibility region. This yields a new CLP that can be solved with the Simplex method. This process is repeated until a solution is found where all Integer variables actually take Integer values. \n",
    "\n",
    "![cutting planes](img/cutting_planes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search (Branch and bound)\n",
    "Branch and bound is one of the most common method to solve MIP problems. This type of algorithms explore the possible solutions iteratively, by dividing the set of possible solutions into smaller set, then finding a *bound* of the objective function in each subset and selecting the subset, or branch with the optimal bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see the set up for a minimization problem. The objective function is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min z = f(x)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the decision variable which can take values from a finite set $C$, i.e. $x \\in C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![branch and bound](img/branch_and_bound_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us divide the set $C$ into two subsets $C_1, C_2$ and find a minimum bound of the objective function in each subset such that: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) \\leq c_1 \\forall x \\in C_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) \\leq c_2 \\forall x \\in C_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "![branch and bound](img/branch_and_bound_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us assume that $c_1 \\leq c_2$. Since we are looking for the minimum value of $z$, we can discard the entire set $C_2$ from the search and continue looking for the solution in branch $C_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now again, let us divide $C_1$ into two subsets $C_{11}, C_{12}$. We can find again a minimum bound for $f(x)$ in each subset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) \\leq c_{11} \\forall x \\in C_{11}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) \\leq c_{12} \\forall x \\in C_{12}$\n",
    "\n",
    "![branch and bound](img/branch_and_bound_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can compare bounds and select the branch with the minimum bound. Note that, at each iteration, we are selecting a better sub-optimal solution. Let us note as $\\alpha$ the index of the subset of $C$ at a given iteration. If $C_\\alpha$ contains only 1 element $\\alpha$ and $c_\\alpha = f(\\alpha)$ is lower than the minimum bound of the other subsets, then $\\alpha$ is the optimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Genetic algorithms \n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms explore the possible solutions using a method inspired in natural selection. The fundamental components of natural selection are the ability to encode information related to the characteristics of individuals into chromosomes and genes, allowing individuals to mix this information in pairs (by *breeding*) so that the next generation inherits features of both parents, also introducing some mutations so that these new individuals may also have unique features. Then, selection will select only the fittest individuals to produce the next generation. Genetic Algorithms can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including Mixed Integer Programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "![genetic algorithm](img/genetic_algorithm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, genetic algorithms work as follows:\n",
    "- **Initialisation:** A random function generates an initial population. The *chromosome* is a set of features or genes that represents a solution of a problem. Each individual in the initial population has a different chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fitness Function:** The objective function is evaluated for each individual to determine which are the fittest individuals in the population. It determines the *fitness score* of each individual. The highest fitness score represents the fittest score of the generation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection Function:**  The individuals with highest fitness score are selected and paired according to their fitness score\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crossover Function:** For every pair, the offspring is created assigning genes from both parents\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutation Function:** A random function changes some genes in the offspring with low probability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Termination:** If the algorithm converges at a given generation, new offspring will have no differential features and will not improve the fittest score, so we can terminate the search\n",
