    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook contains a simple transportation problem and a solution built using PuLP and Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Model Formulation\n",
    "We are trying to find the optimal distribution network to distribute products from a set of plants to a set of retailer regions, using the optimal set of warehouses which can be built in a set of possible locations. Therefore, we decisions to be made are: \n",
    "\n",
    "a) where to build warehouses \n",
    "\n",
    "b) which warehouses should transport which regions,\n",
    " \n",
    "c) how many product units should we transport from each production plant to each warehouse and \n",
    "\n",
    "d) how many units should we transport from every warehouse to every retail region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a warehouse has a certain cost for the company, named the *building cost*. Likewise, each warehouse has a different *operation costs*, which is the cost of operating one warehouse for a period of a year. Transporting units from plants to warehouses and from warehouses to regions also has a cost, and also, handling one unit in a warehouse has an associated cost as well. \n",
    "In this example of the problem, we also have the following requirement from the company: If a warehouse supplies to a region, then it has to supply the demand for all the products (**single-source**).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarise these data using the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **i:** Production plants\n",
    "- **j:** Possible locations (where to  place the warehouses)\n",
    "- **k:** retailer regions\n",
    "- **l:** products\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{kl} \\quad \\text{yearly demand in retail region k  from product l}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_{ijl} \\quad \\text{cost of transporting 1 units of product l  from plant i to warehouse j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$b_{jkl} \\quad \\text{cost of transporting 1 units of product from warehouse j  to retailer region k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_{j} \\quad \\text{cost of building warehouse j}$\n",
    " \n",
    "$F_{j} \\quad \\text{yearly operation costs of warehouse j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_{jl} \\quad \\text{handling cost of 1 unit of product l in warehouse j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{il} \\quad \\text{yearly production capacity of product l in plant i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C \\quad$ maximum amount of warehouses to build\n",
    "$B \\quad$ maximum investment for warehouses building\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_{j} \\quad \\text{binary (1 if a warehouse is placed in location j , 0 otherwise)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$W_{jk} \\quad \\text{binary (1 if the warehouse j supplies the retailer region k), (0 otherwise)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_{ijl} \\quad \\text{integer units of product l transported from plant i to warehouse j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{jkl} \\quad \\text{integer units of product l transported from warehouse j to region k}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function ###\n",
    "The objective is to minimise the cost, taking into account the building costs, the operation costs, the transportation costs, and the handling costs. We can formulate these costs using the definitions above as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building Costs:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "$Cost_{b} = \\sum_{j}{I_{j}*Y_{j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Yearly Operation Costs:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "$Cost_{o} = \\sum_{j}{F_{j}*Y_{j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transportation Costs:** \n",
    "    - From plants to warehouses:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $CostT{ij} = \\sum_{i}{\\sum_{j}{\\sum_{l}{a_{ijl}·S_{ijl}}}}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - From warehouses to regions: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    $CostT_{jk} = \\sum_{j}{\\sum_{k}{\\sum_{l}{b_{jkl}·T_{jkl}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for the unit costs, if we assume that we are not storing any units in a year, then every unit that enters a warehouse from a production plant must be transported to a region, therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}{S_{ijl}} = \\sum_{k}{T_{jkl}} \\quad \\forall j, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the handling cost, we can then write\n",
    "- **Unit handling cost:** \n",
    "\n",
    "$Cost_{h} = \\sum_{j}{\\sum_{k}{\\sum_{l}{v_{jl}·T_{jkl}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in general, the expression of the handling costs, however, since we have the single source requirement, we know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{W_{jk}} = 1 \\quad \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, only one warehouse can supply a region. If this holds, to make sure we satisfy the demand, we know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{d_{kl}·W_{jk}} = d_{kl} \\quad \\forall k, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "And also that the number of products to be transported to each region from every warehouse must match the demand for every product, and therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}\\sum_{l}{{d_{kl}·W_{jk}}} = \\sum_{j}{\\sum_{l}{T_{jkl}}} \\quad \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can express the handling costs as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Cost_{h} = \\sum_{j}{\\sum_{k}{\\sum_{l}{v_{jl}·d_{kl}·W_{jk}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the objective function is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min z = Cost_{b} + Cost_{o} + CostT{ij} + CostT_{jk} + CostT_{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min z = \\sum_{j}{I_{j}*Y_{j}} + \\sum_{j}{F_{j}*Y_{j}} + \\sum_{i}{\\sum_{j}{\\sum_{l}{a_{ijl}·S_{ijl}}}} + \\sum_{j}{\\sum_{k}{\\sum_{l}{b_{jkl}·T_{jkl}}}} + \\sum_{j}{\\sum_{k}{\\sum_{l}{v_{jl}·d_{kl}·W_{jk}}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints ###\n",
    "Now, regarding the constraints, the previous section already introduced some of the requirements of the problem. Let us look at them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demands:**\n",
    "For instance, looking at the flow of materials, the demand in every region and for every product must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{T_{jkl}}= d_{kl} \\quad \\forall k, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Material flows:**\n",
    "Also, the amount of each product that leaves a warehouse cannot be higher than the amount of product that enters a warehouse. Assuming that we do not storing any amount for next periods, then both variables are equal instead of less or equal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}{S_{ijl}} = \\sum_{k}{T_{jkl}} \\forall j, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production capacities:**\n",
    "The amount of a each product produced in a plant must not exceed production capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{S_{ijl}} \\leq c_{il} \\forall i, \\forall l$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial constraints:**\n",
    "The amount of money invested in building warehouses must not exceed the budget limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{I_{j}*Y_{j}} \\leq B$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Company Policy constraint:**\n",
    "The number of warehouses must not exceed the limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{W_{j}} \\leq C$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Source Constraint:** Each region receives all its products from only one warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j}{W_{jk}} = 1 \\quad \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical constraints:** Finally, it is necessary to introduce some logical constraints. First, a warehouse must be built if it supplies to any region.\n",
    "\n",
    "$W_{jk} \\leq Y_{j} \\quad \\forall j, \\forall k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both decision variables are binary, with this constraint we make sure that if any warehouse supplies to a region, i.e. if any $W_{jk}$ for any value of k is 1, then we must build a warehouse in that location, i.e. $Y_{j}$ must be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an alternative formulation of this constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{k} W_{jk} \\leq M·Y_{j} \\quad \\forall j$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where M is a large number. In this alternative formulation, again, if any warehouse supplies a region, we make sure that the warehouse is built. Otherwise, $Y_{j}$ must be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a warehouse will supply a region only when the amount transported of all products from such warehouse to such region is non zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{l}T_{jkl} \\leq M·W_{jk} \\quad \\forall j, \\forall k$"
