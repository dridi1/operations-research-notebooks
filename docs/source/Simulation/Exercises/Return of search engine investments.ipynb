    "- **S (Total Search results in period):** Total number of times the keywords are used in searches in the planning period.\n",
    "- **CPM (Cost per 1000 impressions):** Cost of the search engine per every 1000 impressions, every time your website appears in a search result\n",
    "- **CPC (Cost per click):** Cost per every click\n",
    "- **CTR (Click Through Rate):** rate between the number of clicks and number of impressions\n",
    "- **CVR (Conversion Rate):** rate between the number of visitors and the number of users\n",
