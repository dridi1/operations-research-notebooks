    "# Unconstrained Non-Linear Programming\n",
    "## One dimensional problems set-up\n",
    "Let us first consider just one decision variable. The objective is to search a maximum or minimum of a non-linear function. Without loss of generalisation, let us consider that the objective is to minimize the objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min f(x) \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Any (local or global) minimum of $f(x)$, $x^*$ will have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First derivative test**: The first derivative of a function at a point $x^*$ represents the slope of a line tangent to $f(x)$ at $x^*$. In a minimum, the first derivative is equal to zero, $\\frac{df(x)}{dx}=0$, meaning that the tangent is horizontal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second derivative test**: The second derivative is positive $\\frac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2}$, meaning that the slope of the tangent is increasing and therefore, it must be less than zero for $x < x^*$, meaning that the function decreases before $x^*$, and greater than zero for $x > x^*$, meaning that the function increases after $x^*$. Therefore $f(x)$ takes its minimum value at $x^*$, at least in its proximity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition,  $x^*$ is a critical point. For a maximum, the second derivative is negative and using the same logic, $f(x)$ decreases in the proximity of $x^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bi-section algorithm\n",
    "Since the sign of the first derivative changes at a critical point, it is possible to search a critical point if we find two initial points such that the sign of the first derivative is different. The simplest algorithm that uses this property is known as the bi-section method and it can be formulated as this: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialisation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an acceptable error $\\epsilon$\n",
    "2. Find an initial left point $x_L$ such that $\\frac{df(x_L)}{dx} < 0$\n",
    "3. Find an initial right point $x_R$ such that $\\frac{df(x_R)}{dx} > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration**\n",
    "1. Bisect the range $[x_L, x_R] \\quad x'=\\frac{𝑥_𝑅−𝑥_𝐿}{2}$\n",
    "2. If $\\frac{df(x')}{dx} < 0$ then make $𝑥_𝐿=x'$, else if $\\frac{df(x')}{dx} < 0$ then make $𝑥_𝑅=x'$\n",
    "3. If $𝑥_𝑅−𝑥_𝐿 \\leq 2\\epsilon$ then the solution is $\\frac{𝑥_𝑅−𝑥_𝐿}{2}$, else repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we start with two initial values for which the first derivative has different sign. If the function is continuously differentiable, then there must be a value somewhere in between these values where the first derivative is zero. Then, we make a bi-section and continue looking in the part of the range for which there is a change in the sign of the first derivative. The process stops either when we find exactly a critical point or when the distance between both points is less than the acceptable error. \n",
