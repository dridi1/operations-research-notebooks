    "There are two bars in the paradise beach resort, Awesome Sloth and Brave Flamingo. Each one of the two bars charges its own price for a beer, either 2€, 4€, or 5€. The cost of obtaining and serving the beer can be neglected. It is expected that 60% of the tourists are relaxed and casual and choose the bars randomly regardless of the price, while 40% are more thoughtful and will go to the bar with the lowest price, and split evenly in case both bars offer the same price. \n",
