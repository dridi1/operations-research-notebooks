    "- There is a 90% probability that a good car will be in a good state at the beginning of next year \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a 5% probability that it will be in a regular state\n",

    "It costs €12,000 to buy a good car, but a regular one can be found for €5,000. \n",
    "A bad car has no sale value and must be immediately replaced with a good one. It costs €1,000 a year for a good car and €2,000 for a regular car to function properly. \n",
    "Let us assume that the cost to keep a car functioning properly throughout 1 year only depends on the status of the car at the beginning of the year.\n",
    "Let us assume that the bad state occurs only at the end of a year, and then (at the beginning of the next year) the car in a bad state *must be replaced immediately*.\n",
