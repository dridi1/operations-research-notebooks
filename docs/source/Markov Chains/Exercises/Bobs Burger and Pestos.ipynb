    "# Problem definition\n",
    "Tina Belcher, brand new manager of the new Bob´s burger parlour downtown San Francisco,  wants to analyse the impact on the market and the loyalty of the customers of Bob’s Burger and Pesto´s, an Italian restaurant nearby. It is assumed that one customer dines once a week at Bob’s or at Pesto´s, but not at both.\n",
    "Tina has collected information from 100 consumers over a 10-week period. When checking the data, she discovered that of all the customers who consumed at Bob’s in a given week, 90 % returned to the restaurant following week, while 10 % switched to Pesto’s. Of all the consumers who consumed at Pesto’s in a given week, 80 % returned to the same place the following week, but 20 % switched to Bob´s.\n",
    "Assuming that the transition probabilities are the same for every customer and that they not change over time, we can get insights modelling customer fidelity with Markov chains.\n"
