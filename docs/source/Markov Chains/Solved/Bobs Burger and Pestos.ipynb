    "# Problem definition\n",
    "Tina Belcher, brand new manager of the new Bob´s burger parlour downtown San Francisco,  wants to analyse the impact on the market and the loyalty of the customers of Bob’s Burger and Pesto´s, an Italian restaurant nearby. It is assumed that one customer dines once a week at Bob’s or at Pesto´s, but not at both.\n",
    "Tina has collected information from 100 consumers over a 10-week period. When checking the data, she discovered that of all the customers who consumed at Bob’s in a given week, 90 % returned to the restaurant following week, while 10 % switched to Pesto’s. Of all the consumers who consumed at Pesto’s in a given week, 80 % returned to the same place the following week, but 20 % switched to Bob´s.\n",
    "Assuming that the transition probabilities are the same for every customer and that they not change over time, we can get insights modelling customer fidelity with Markov chains.\n"

    "## Model\n",
    "We model the decision of customers as a Markov chain, assuming two possible states every week (which is the discrete event period of our model). The states are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $s_1$: represents the customers decision to go to Bob´s Burger.\n",
    "- $s_2$: represents the customers decision to go to Pestos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with the data collected by Tina, we can estimate the transition probability Matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_{11}$: It is the probability that a customer goes back to Bob´s Burger after they have been to Bob´s Burger. Tina discovered that this probability is 0.9 or 90%.\n",
    "- $p_{12}$: It is the probability that a customer goes to Pesto´s after going to Bob´s Burger. Tina estimates that this probability is 10%. Clearly, it has to be ($1-p_{11}=0.1$) since we only consider two possible states and at any given time, the system has to be in one particular state, so the transition probabilities need to add up to 1.\n",
    "- $p_{11}$: It is the probability that a customer goes back to Bob´s Burger after they have been to Bob´s Burger. Tina discovered that this probability is 0.9 or 90%.\n",
    "- $p_{21}$: It is the probability that a customer goes to Bob´s Burger after going to Pesto´s. Tina estimates this probability to be 0.2.\n",
    "- $p_{22}$: It is the probability that a customer goes to Pesto´s for two consecutive week, 0.8 according to Tina´s data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the transition probability matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P^{(1)} = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0.9 & 0.1\\\\\n",

    "We can use Graphviz to represent the Markov chain:\n"
