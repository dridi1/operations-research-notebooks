Continuous Linear Programming
=============================================
In this chapter, we will cover both theoretical and practical topics related to Continuous Linear Programming (CLP) using Python.
CLP allows us to model, solve and analyse the solution of optimization problems using linear equations. "The world is not linear" but still, CLP is a really powerful tool to solve a pletora of real world optimisation problems.

Exercises
__________
In this section you have a collection of CLP problems sorted by difficulty:

- **Easy problems**: You can tackle these problems after a first introduction to CLP.
- **Normal problems**: These problems require that you are familiar with concepts like Duality and the Simplex method.
- **Hard problems**: This is the type of problems that definitively get you ready for the exam.
