    "    - **upBound:** The upper bound of the variable. The default is unrestricted (Inf).\n",
    "    - **cat:** Either 'Continuous' for continuous variables, 'Binary' for binary variables or 'Integer' for Integer variables. We will see in detail binary and integer variables in the course unit for Mixed Integer Programming, but now you know that you will be able to model and solve this type of problems with PuLP. The default is 'Continuous'.\n",
