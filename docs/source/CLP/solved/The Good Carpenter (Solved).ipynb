    "\"The Fog Ltd\" is a modern furniture company that makes tables and chairs. The selling price of a table is 30€ and the selling price of chairs is 10€. \n",
    "The carpenter at the company works up to 40 hours and needs 6 hours to make a table and 3 hours to make a chair. \n",
    "Customer demand requires that he makes at least 3 times as many chairs as tables. \n",
    "Tables take up four times as much storage space as chairs and there is room for at most four tables each week.\n",
