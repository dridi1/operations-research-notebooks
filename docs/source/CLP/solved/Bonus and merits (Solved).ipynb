    "A company pays a yearly bonus to employees based on the following indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance:** Performance is evaluated by the direct manager using a quantitative method. The indicator is labelled as $CM_{1}$ and measured in a scale from 1 to 5.\n",
    "2. **Involvement:** Involvement in social media, events, coaching and other voluntary activities. Involvement is measured by the human resource department using a quantitative method. The indicator is labelled as $CM_{2}$ and measured in a scale from 1 to 5.\n",
    "3. **Professional development:** Professional development evaluates the accomplishment of training programs and courses suggested by the proximity manager. The indicator is labelled as $CM_{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the total score obtained among all employees is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum (𝑪𝑴_{𝟏}) = 𝟏𝟔𝟐𝟓$ Total points in performance\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum (𝑪𝑴_{2}) = 𝟏𝟒𝟎𝟗$ Total points in involvement\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum (𝑪𝑴_{3}) = 𝟏𝟑𝟖𝟕$ Total points in professional development\n",
    "\n",
    "The company wants to calculate bonuses using a linear expression weighting the three indicators\n",
    "The board established the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No employee should receive more than 5000€ in bonuses\n",
    "- The value of performance is twice the value of involvement and professional development\n",
    "- The total budget for bonuses this year is 1.5M€\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate a LPP that determines the optimal formula to calculate employee bonuses."

    "- $x_1$: Coefficient in the bonuses linear expression for the performance KPI\n",

    "- $x_2$: Coefficient in the bonuses linear expression for the involvement KPI\n",

    "- $x_3$: Coefficient in the bonuses linear expression for the professional development KPI\n",

The type of objective must be of type maximise (otherwise the solution will always be zero), and we do not use any coefficients so that the solution is not biased towards any indicator.\n",
