    "# Problem Definition\n",
    "Suppose you are a financial advisor at March & Sanchis Investments Ltd.  and your client has €1,000,000 to invest in four different types of assets: stocks, bonds, real estate, and crypto assets, with the Expected Returns and risk (an estimation of the risk per euro invested) expressed in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Asset Type\t | Expected Return (%)\t| Risk (%) |\n",
    "|--------------|----------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Stocks\t     |10\t                  | 1.25     |\n",
    "| Bonds        |6\t                    | 0.5      |\n",
    "| Real Estate  |8\t                    | 0.7      |\n",
    "| Crypto Assets|15\t                  | 2.1      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to help the client select the optimal portfolio of investments, maximizing the Expected Return. Assume that the investments are independent and take into account the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Budget:** The total investment cannot exceed the budget of the client (€1,000,000)\n",
    "- **Personal Preferences:** The client wants to invest at least €200,000 in real estate due to personal interests in owning property, and does not want to invest more than €400,000 in crypto assets as she would like to be cautious and limit exposure.\n",
    "- **Risk:** The overall risk estimation cannot exceed 12% of the expected return\n",
    "\n",
    "Model this problem as a continuous linear programming problem. What are the decision variables? What is the objective function? What are the constraints?"
