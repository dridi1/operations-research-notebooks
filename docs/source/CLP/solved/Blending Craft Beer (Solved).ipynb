    "Duff Beer is an american brewery that sells alcoholic beverages worldwide. Duff beer has a very large market share in the US. One of the new business lines of Duff Beer is in the craft beer sector. Duff beer buys 3 types of wort from local suppliers. The availability of wort (in liters) and the price for each of them is specified in Table 1. \n",
