    "## Problem Description\n",
    "Will Robinson and his crew are lost in space and have crashed their spaceship in an alien planet. They need to collect metals to repair the engine of their spaceship. More specifically, the piece to repair is made of a metal alloy of chrome, aluminium, and titanium. To build the new piece, Will needs to collect 1 kilogram of chrome, 800 grams of aluminium and 1.5 kilograms of  titanium. Will and his crew can gather these metals from 3 different mining locations they have identified around the camp. Will has estimated the average kg/hour that can be extracted in each location:\n",
