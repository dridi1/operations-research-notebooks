    "## Definition\n",
    "Continuous Linear Programming (CLP) spans a wide set of OR problems that can be modeled based on the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unknown variables are continuous: The result variable and the decision variables can take any real value. Also, all the different coefficients can take any real value.\n",
    "- Objectives and constraints are linear expressions: The relationships between the variables are expressed as linear expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, CLP establishes a rather simplified model of real world problems. Many assumptions are needed to represent real problems as a set of linear expressions. Yet, CLP is a very powerful tool in OR and it can provide valuable insights to decision making in different fields. The main reason is that, once these assumptions are taken, linear algebra provides valuable tools to find an optimal solution and analyse it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main types of problems that will be covered in the CLP exercises belong to two problem types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Production mix: Production mix problems help us determine the optimal allocation of resources in the production of good or services to either minimise costs or maximise profits\n",
    "- Blending problems: In blending problems, the objective is to find the optimal combination of components in a set of products that either minimise costs or maximise profits \n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up\n",
    "In CLP, the objective variable, noted as $z$, can take any real value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$z \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of this unknown variable $z$ is a function of another set of unknowns, which are called decision variables and that represent our decisions. These decision variables are noted as $x_j$, where $j$ is an integer (sub)index that goes from 1 to $n$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$z = \\operatorname{f}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will have $n$ different decision variables, that are going to be continuous. And, in extension, z is also going to be continuous. So now we know from where does the C in CLP comes from. Next, in CLP, the function f is a linear function. What we want is to maximise or minimise z, which as we said is a linear function and therefore can be expressed as the sum of the product of the decision variables multiplied by a set of coefficients, which are noted as $c_1$ to $c_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\max or \\min z = \\operatorname{f}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = c_1·x_1+c_2·x_2+...+c_n·x_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "And our optimisation function is subject to a set of constraints, which are also linear functions of the decision variables, that is, the sum product of the decision variables times a set of coefficients noted as $a_{ij}$ must be less than, greater than, or equal to another coefficient noted as $b_j$. \n",

    "Note that coefficients a have two sub-indexes, the second is equal to the index of the corresponding decision variable, and the first is equal to the sub-index of b.\n",
    "These new index $i$ ranges from 1 to $m$ and therefore, our optimisation function is subject to a set of $m$ constraints.\n",
    "We will refer to the expressions to the left of the inequality as the Left Hand Side (LHS), and to the other side of the relationship as the Right Hand Side (RHS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, note that we can use the sum operator to represent the objective function in a more compressed form, that is, the LHS is equal to the sum of the product of cj times xj for j equal to 1 up to n. Note that this is can also be represented as the dot product of two vectors, the vector $x$ with the decision variables and the vector $c$ of the coefficients.\n",

    "### Production Mix Problems\n",
    "In production mix problems, the decision maker needs to create products to satisfy demand using limited resources. The objective is to maximise the profits, taking into account the demand and the limited availability of resources. \n",
    "Production mix problems represent the simplext form of optimization problem in operations research, where the objective is to maximise an utility function (in this case profits) bounded by a set of constraints. \n",
    "Normally, production mix problems are not found in real world applications, but rather, they are part of larger problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us note the objective variable profits as $z$, expressed in a monetary unit (e.g. €). \n",
    "\n",
    "- $z$: profits in €. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision maker needs to decide how many units of each product type to manufacture. Let us assume there are $n$ different products. Now, let us note the decision variables $x_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as the amount of product $j \\in [1, ..., n]$ to be produced, in a production unit: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_j$: Quantity of product $j$ to be produced in product units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to maximize profits. Let us note the profit per unit of product $j$ as $p_j$: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_j$: Profit per unit of product $j$ to be produced in €/unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the objective function is to maximise the sum of the product of the number of units produced times the profit per unit, for each product type: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\max z = x_1*p_1 + x_2*p_2 + x_3*p_3 + ... + x_n*p_n = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j*p_j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, there might be requirements on the demand. Let us note the demand of product j as $d_j$. The demand constraints will be of the type:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1 \\geq d_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_2 \\geq d_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",

    "\n",
    "$x_j \\geq d_j \\quad \\forall j \\in [1, ..., n]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Different limited resources are used to produce each product. Let us assume that we have $m$ different resources. Let us note as $b_i$ as the quantity available of resource $i$ ($i \\in [1, ..., m]$), expressed in a given unit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $b_i$: Availability of resource $i$ in resource unit.\n",

    "- $a_{ij}$: Requirement of resource $i$ to produce a unit of product $j$ in resource unit / product unit. \n",
    " \n",
    "Then, for each resource $i$, we need to ensure that the total amount used is less or equal the total amount available. The amount used to produce a specific number of products will be the number of units products (e.g. $x_j$) multiplied by the amount required to produce one unit $x_{ij}$. If we sum across all products, we obtain the total amount used, which needs to be lower than the availability. Let´s take the resource indexed 1 as an example: \n",

    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j*a_{1j}}\\leq b_1$\n",

    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j*a_{ij}}\\leq b_i \\quad \\forall i \\in [1, ..., m]$\n",
    " \n",
    "That is, for every resource, we need to ensure that the sum of the quantities used to produce each type of product are less or equal than the total amount available. \n",
