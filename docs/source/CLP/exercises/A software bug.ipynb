    "# A software bug\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "You are using a legacy software to solve a production mix Continuous Linear Programming (CLP) problem in your company where the objective is to maximise profits. The following table provides the solution of the primal, dual and a sensitivity analysis for the three decision variables that represent the quantities to produce of each product\n",
    "\n",
    "|Variables | Solution | Reduced cost | Objective Coefficient | Lower bound | Upper bound|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|$x_1$  | 300.00 | ? | 30.00 | 24.44 | Inf|\n",
    "|$x_2$  | 33.33 | ? | 20.00 | -0.00 | 90.00|\n",
    "|$x_3$  | 0 | -8.33 | 40.00 | -Inf | 48.33 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** Notice that there are some values missing (a bug in the software shows a ? sign instead of a numerical value, remember to use Python the next time around). Fill the missing values and explain your decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** According to the provided solution, which of the three products has the highest impact in your objective function? Motivate your response. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**c.** What does the model tell you about product $x_3$. Is it profitable to manufacture under the current conditions modeled in the problem? Provide quantitative values to motivate your response. \n",
    "\n",
    "**d.** Recall that in this type of problem, the objective coefficient represents the marginal profit per unit of product. What would happen if the objective function of variable $x_3$ is increased over 50? Describe what would be the impact in the obtained solution\n",
    "The following table represents the value obtained for the decision variables related to the constraints: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Constraint | Right Hand Side | Shadow Price | Slack | Min RHS | Max RHS |\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|----|\n",
    "| $s_1$ | 400.00 | 6.67 | 0.00 | 300.00 | 525.00 | \n",
    "| $s_2$ | 600.00 | 11.67 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 800.00 | \n",
    "| $s_3$ | 600.00 | 0.00 | 166.67 | 433.33 | Inf |\n",
    "\n",
    "Bearing in mind that the constraints represent the availability of 3 limited resources (operating time in minutes) and that the type of constraints is in every case \"less or equal\" answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "**e.** Which decision variables are basic? How many are there and, is this result expected? Motivate your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**g.** Now, with the money saved, you could invest to increase the availability of other limited resources. Again, indicate which one would you select and by how much you would increase the availability of this resource without changing the production mix. Motivate your response \n",
    "\n",
    "**h.** How do the columns of the two tables relate to the primal and dual problem? Moreover, for each column, not considering upper and lower bounds, write down a brief description of each column and the relationship it has with the primal and dual problem"
