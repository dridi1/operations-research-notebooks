    "## Analysis of the problem model\n",
    "\n",
    "Spellman´s Ltd is a company that produces two types of chilling soft drinks: A, and B. Both beverages use a semi-elaborate C, another expensive ingredient D and other ingredients that are not relevant for production planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selling price of drink A is 3€/liter and the selling price of drink B is 2€/liter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 liter of drink A uses 3 grams of ingredient D. A liter of drink B uses 1 gram of ingredient D. There are only 3 grams of ingredient D available per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factory only has one mixer to elaborate both drink types and the semi-elaborate. It takes 1 hour to process a liter of drink A, 1 hour to process 1 liter of drink B, and 1 hour to process 1cl of semi-elaborate C. The mixer is available 6 hours per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drink A uses 2cl of semi-elaborate C and drink B uses 1cl of semi-elaborate C. The company has 3cl of semi-elaborate C plus the amount they decide to produce every day.\n",

With the new set-up, the daily availability of semi-elaborate C will be the sum of the semi-elaborate C produced at Spellman's plus the amount purchased from the new provider. What changes are needed in the problem to evaluate the subcontracting of semi-elaborate C? (1.5 points)\n",
