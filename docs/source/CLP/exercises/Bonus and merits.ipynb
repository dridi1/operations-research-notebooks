    "## Problem definition\n",
    "A company pays a yearly bonus to employees based on the following indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance:** Performance is evaluated by the direct manager using a quantitative method. The indicator is labelled as $CM_{1}$ and measured in a scale from 1 to 5.\n",
    "2. **Involvement:** Involvement in social media, events, coaching and other voluntary activities. Involvement is measured by the human resource department using a quantitative method. The indicator is labelled as $CM_{2}$ and measured in a scale from 1 to 5.\n",
    "3. **Professional development:** Professional development evaluates the accomplishment of training programs and courses suggested by the proximity manager. The indicator is labelled as $CM_{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the total score obtained among all employes is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum (𝑪𝑴_{𝟏}) = 𝟏𝟔𝟐𝟓$ Total points in performance\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum (𝑪𝑴_{2}) = 𝟏𝟒𝟎𝟗$ Total points in involvement\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum (𝑪𝑴_{3}) = 𝟏𝟑𝟖𝟕$ Total points in professional development\n",
    "\n",
    "The company wants to calculate bonuses using a linear expression weighting the three \n",
    "The board established the following rules:\n",
    "- No employee should receive more than 5000€ in bonuses\n",
    "- The value of performance is twice the value of involvement and professional development\n",
    "- The total budget for bonuses this year is 1.5M€\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate a LPP that determines the optimal formula to calculate employee bonuses."
